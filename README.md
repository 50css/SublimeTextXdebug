# SublimeTextXdebug

Xdebug debugger client integration for Sublime Text.
Based on the [SublimeXdebug](https://github.com/Kindari/SublimeXdebug) package by [Kindari](https://github.com/Kindari).

## Objective

By writing a new package based on the concept of [SublimeXdebug](https://github.com/Kindari/SublimeXdebug) I aim to:
- support both Sublime Text 2 and 3 (python version 2.* and 3.*)
- conditional breakpoints
- remote debugging (path mapping)
